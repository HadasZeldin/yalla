echo "Hello ,World!"

Create a Jenkins pipeline that includes the following:
Stage 1: Echo a custom message provided by the user.
Stage 2: Clone a Git repository from a URL provided by the user.
Use pipeline parameters to capture user inputs for the message and the Git repository URL.
Ensure that the pipeline is functional and outputs the expected results.
